/*
I'm opening up a very hip artisanal vodka company called Purple Grain. Please help complete my incredibly ugly logo. Style the <h1> with the following styles:
uppercase all the letters, without touching the html! (note: you weren't taught how to do this, you will need to flex your googling skills)
set the font-family to be 'monospace'
center align the text
set the font weight to 100
make the text size 40px
set spacing between letters to 20px
add a wavy plum underline (plum is the color) - I can't test this, but make sure it looks like the image!

The HTML code is:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hipster Logo</title>
    <link href="app.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Purple Grain</h1>
</body>
</html>

h1 {
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-family: monospace;
  text-align: center;
  font-weight: 100;
  letter-spacing: 20px;
  text-decoration: underline;     
  text-decoration-color: plum;  
  text-decoration-style: wavy;
  font-size: 40px;
}
