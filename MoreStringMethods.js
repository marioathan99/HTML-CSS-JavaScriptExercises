//I've provided you with a word variable, set to "skateboard".  Your goal is to use string methods on word, so that you end up with the string "beard". 
//1.Use a string method to extract the "board" part of "skateboard"  (using the slice method)
//2.Replace the "o" in board with an "e" (using the replace method)
word.slice(5,10);
word.replace("o", "e");
let facialHair = "beard";
